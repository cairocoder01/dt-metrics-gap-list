# Disciple.Tools - Metrics Gap List

Visualize the Gaps in Gospel Saturation

## Purpose

When tracking contacts and groups to monitor Gospel saturation in a given area,
you want to see [where the Kingdom isn't](https://zume.training/eyes-to-see-where-the-kingdom-isnt/).

> Every disciple needs to be equipped to see where the Kingdom isn’t. There are places all around us where God’s will is not being done on earth as it is in heaven. There are giant gaps where brokenness, pain, persecution, suffering and even death are a part of normal, everyday life. Those gaps are what we are to work on closing in our labors for the Kingdom while we are on this earth.
>
> \- Zume

Existing metrics in Disciple.Tools show where you do have contacts, groups and churches,
but it doesn't specifically highlight where there ISN'T Kingdom impact happening.
This plugin adds a Gap List - both as a map and a flat list of locations - so that you
can prioritize your Kingdom efforts.
